## Testing

### Manual testing
I conducted a lot of tests during programming. I used a live preview to check if everything i programmed functioned as intended

### Testing on different screen sizes
I used my browser tools to check how the page looked on different devices

# Deployment

This website is deployed to Heroku from a GitHub repository. The following steps were taken:

## Creating Repository on GitHub

1. First, make sure you are signed into GitHub and go to the [Code Institute's template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template).
2. Then click on "use this template" and select "Create a new repository" from the drop-down. Enter the name for the repository and click "Create repository from template".
3. Once the repository was created, I clicked the green Gitpod button to create a workspace in Gitpod so that I could write the code for the site.

## Creating an app on Heroku

1. After creating the repository on GitHub, head over to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and sign in.
2. On the home page, click "New" and select "Create new app" from the drop-down.
3. Give the app a name (this must be unique) and select a region. I chose Europe as I am in Europe. Then click "Create app".

## Add heroku postgres to heroku app 

1. On your Heroku dashboard click configure add-ons 
2. Click find more add-ons
3. Scroll down until you find Heroku Postgres
4. Click the Install Heroku Postgres button
5. Choose app to provision the add-on to 
6. Go back to your app dashboard and click settings
7. Click reveal config vars and copy the HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_AMBER_URL and add the value to DATABASE_URL
4. Head over to Gitpod and create a Database URL environment variable in your `.env` file and set it equal to the copied URL.

## Deploying to Heroku

1. Head back over to Heroku and click on your app and then go to the "Settings" tab.
2. On the settings page, scroll down to the "config vars" section and enter the following:
   - `DATABASE_URL`: which you will set equal to the ElephantSQL URL.
   - `Secret key`: this can be anything.
   - `CLOUDINARY_URL`: this will be set to your Cloudinary URL.
   - `Port`: which will be set to 8000.
3. Then scroll to the top and go to the "Deploy" tab and go down to the "Deployment method" section and select GitHub and then sign into your account.
4. Below that in the "search for a repository to connect to" search box enter the name of your repository that you created on GitHub and click connect.
5. Once it has been connected scroll down to the "Manual Deploy" and click "Deploy branch". When it has deployed you will see a "view app" button below and this will bring you to your newly deployed app.
Please note that when deploying manually you will have to deploy after each change you make to your repository.

Heroku needs two additional files in order to deploy properly:
- `requirements.txt`
- `Procfile`

You can install this project's requirements (where applicable) using:


- pip3 install -r requirements.txt

 - If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs to be updated using:
  - pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
The Procfile can be created with the following command:
 - echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile

 Replace `app_name` with the name of your primary Django app; the folder where `settings.py` is located.

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

- Either:
  - Select Automatic Deployment from the Heroku app.
  - Or:
    In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command:
    ```
    heroku login -i
    ```
  - heroku login -i

  - heroku git:remote -a app_name

After performing the standard Git add, commit, and push to GitHub, you can now type:

- git push heroku main
