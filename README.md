## Design & Planning 

The design and planning of the "Hotel Jeri" web application focused on creating an intuitive and visually appealing user interface that enhances user experience. We implemented a responsive design using Bootstrap, ensuring accessibility across all devices. Google Fonts and Font Awesome icons were integrated to provide a modern and clean aesthetic. The navigation bar offers clear links to essential pages such as Home, Booking, About Jeri, and user-specific sections like My Bookings, Login, and Register, facilitating easy navigation. Secure authentication features, including registration and login, were prioritized to protect user data. The planning phase involved detailed wireframing and prototyping, incorporating stakeholder feedback to refine the design and ensure a user-centric approach.

## User Stories, Bugs and Fix

# Overview
This report summarizes the completion of a recent college project, focusing on the user stories and tasks involved. As the sole contributor to this project, I encountered several challenges, particularly in task management and tracking. Despite these challenges, all tasks were completed successfully.

- Styling Bootstrap 
- Sign in Page 
- Change booking 
- Create Booking System 
- Create Folders 
- Booking app 
- set a Database 
- acoount Registration 
- Design Landing Page

# Challenges Faced
As the sole individual responsible for this project, I encountered several challenges:

- **Complexity of Tasks:** Certain tasks, such as creating an authentication system and designing the landing page, were complex and required extensive time and research.
- **Time Management:** Balancing multiple tasks simultaneously proved challenging, especially given the academic workload.
- **Resource Constraints:** With limited resources and support, I had to rely heavily on self-learning and online resources to complete the project tasks.

# Apology and Areas for Improvement
I acknowledge that there was a lack of control and organization in tracking the progress of user stories. The following areas need improvement:

- **Task Tracking:** Tasks were not always clearly tracked or updated, leading to periods of uncertainty about the projectâ€™s progress.
- **Progress Monitoring:** Regular updates and self-assessment were not consistently performed, which could have helped in identifying and addressing issues earlier.
- **Prioritization:** Better prioritization of tasks would have ensured that critical tasks were addressed in a timely manner.

I apologize for these shortcomings and the resulting inefficiencies. To improve future projects, I will implement the following practices:

- **Regular Status Updates:** Ensure that all tasks are updated regularly with their current status.
- **Clear Task Assignments:** Create a more structured timeline and checklist for each task.
- **Improved Time Management:** Allocate specific times for each task to ensure balanced progress across all project areas.

# Conclusion
Despite the challenges and areas for improvement, the project was completed successfully with all user stories marked as done. This project provided valuable learning experiences and highlighted the importance of effective task management and tracking. Moving forward, I am committed to refining my project management skills to ensure more efficient and organized project execution.

  # Deployment

This website is deployed to Heroku from a GitHub repository. The following steps were taken:

## Creating Repository on GitHub

1. First, make sure you are signed into GitHub and go to the [Code Institute's template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template).
2. Then click on "use this template" and select "Create a new repository" from the drop-down. Enter the name for the repository and click "Create repository from template".
3. Once the repository was created, I clicked the green Gitpod button to create a workspace in Gitpod so that I could write the code for the site.

## Creating an app on Heroku

1. After creating the repository on GitHub, head over to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and sign in.
2. On the home page, click "New" and select "Create new app" from the drop-down.
3. Give the app a name (this must be unique) and select a region. I chose Europe as I am in Europe. Then click "Create app".

## Create a database On ElephantSQL

1. Log into the [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/) from Code Institute website and enter your email and click submit.
2. As soon as you sign up you will receive an email with all the details about your PostgreSQL database.
3. You will find the PostgreSQL URL, copy that.
4. Head over to Gitpod and create a Database URL environment variable in your `env.py` file and set it equal to the copied URL.

## Deploying to Heroku

1. Head back over to Heroku and click on your app and then go to the "Settings" tab.
2. On the settings page, scroll down to the "config vars" section and enter the following:
   - `DATABASE_URL`: which you will set equal to the ElephantSQL URL.
   - `Secret key`: this can be anything.
   - `CLOUDINARY_URL`: this will be set to your Cloudinary URL.
   - `Port`: which will be set to 8000.
3. Then scroll to the top and go to the "Deploy" tab and go down to the "Deployment method" section and select GitHub and then sign into your account.
4. Below that in the "search for a repository to connect to" search box enter the name of your repository that you created on GitHub and click connect.
5. Once it has been connected scroll down to the "Manual Deploy" and click "Deploy branch". When it has deployed you will see a "view app" button below and this will bring you to your newly deployed app.

Please note that when deploying manually you will have to deploy after each change you make to your repository.

Heroku needs two additional files in order to deploy properly:
- `requirements.txt`
- `Procfile`

You can install this project's requirements (where applicable) using:


- pip3 install -r requirements.txt

 - If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs to be updated using:
  - pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
The Procfile can be created with the following command:
 - echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile

 Replace `app_name` with the name of your primary Django app; the folder where `settings.py` is located.

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

- Either:
  - Select Automatic Deployment from the Heroku app.
  - Or:
    In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command:
    ```
    heroku login -i
    ```
  - heroku login -i

  - heroku git:remote -a app_name

After performing the standard Git add, commit, and push to GitHub, you can now type:

- git push heroku main
